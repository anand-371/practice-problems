/*
A Flight of Stairs Sequel

You are given positive integers n and k. You are currently at stair 0 and want to climb to stair n. You can either climb 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time, but you can only climb 3 stairs at most k times.

Return the number of ways to climb to the nth stair. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 37
Example 1
Input
n = 4
k = 1
Output
7
Explanation
Here are the different ways we can climb the stairs:

[1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 1, 2]
[2, 2]
[3, 1]
[1, 3]
Example 2
Input
n = 3
k = 0
Output
3
Explanation
Here are the different ways we can climb the stairs:

[1, 1, 1]
[2, 1]
[1, 2]
Note that we can't climb 3 stairs at once since k = 0
