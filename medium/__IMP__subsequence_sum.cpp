/*
Subsequence Sum
Given a list of integers nums, select a subsequence of strictly increasing numbers, where the differences of each two numbers is the same as the differences of their two indexes.

Return the maximum sum of such a subsequence.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [5, 6, 8, 8, 7, 4]
Output
19
Explanation
We pick the subsequence [5, 6, 8] which has the indexes [0, 1, 3]. The differences between each consecutive numbers is [1, 2] which is the same as the differences of their indexes.
