"""
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findTwoElement() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an array of integers of size 2 denoting the answer ( The first index contains B and second index contains A.)

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
